# 10 Fast Finger App
 
This application was developed with pure Javascript to help you type 10 fast fingers.
We fetch the data from the local JSON file and data is written to the screen using DOM.
Level buttons, result field and head section where we write current level information are also written on the screen using DOM.
Our current number of true at the current level are saved in Local Storage and written in the "number of true" in the result field. 
Local Storage is cleared when the page is refreshed and when we complete the current level.
